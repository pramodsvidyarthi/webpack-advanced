#webpack Advanced Trials

- using [hjs-webpack](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/hjs-webpack)  for webpack boilerplate config

##code splitting using webpack

-  breaking the code into smaller chunks and **dynamically** loading the chunks on demand
-  extracting ***common***libraries into a separate chunk called vendors so that it can be cached
